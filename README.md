# ghOSt: Fast &amp; Flexible User-Space Delegation of Linux Scheduling

ghOSt is a general-purpose delegation of scheduling policy implemented on top of
the Linux kernel. The ghOSt framework provides a rich API that receives
scheduling decisions for processes from userspace and actuates them as
transactions. Programmers can use any language or tools to develop policies,
which can be upgraded without a machine reboot. ghOSt supports policies for a
range of scheduling objectives, from Âµs-scale latency, to throughput, to energy
efficiency, and beyond, and incurs low overheads for scheduling actions. Many
policies are just a few hundred lines of code. Overall, ghOSt provides a
performant framework for delegation of thread scheduling policy to userspace
processes that enables policy optimization, non-disruptive upgrades, and fault
isolation.

You must compile and install this kernel in order to use the [ghOSt userspace
component](https://www.github.com/google/ghost-userspace).

## Requirements

This kernel is Linux 5.11. We recommend installing Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, which ships
with Linux 5.4 by default, as the distribution. Compile this kernel on Ubuntu
20.04 and then replace the existing 5.4 kernel with this one.

## Goal

We aim to gather feedback from users and hear about potential use cases
before upstreaming the patches brought here to the mainline linux repository.
The series of patches applied to this repository cannot be shipped as a kernel module
since we have to change the core scheduling code to deliver our patches to mainline.
